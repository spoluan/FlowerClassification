**Project Descriptions**

The flower_photos dataset is a publicly available image dataset that contains thousands of labeled images of different flowers. It is commonly used as a benchmark dataset for training and evaluating deep learning models for image classification tasks. The dataset consists of 5,740 images of flowers belonging to 102 different categories, with each category representing a specific type of flower.

In this project, we will be using the flower_photos dataset for training a deep learning model for learning purposes. The dataset will be used to train a neural network model to classify images of flowers into their respective categories. By utilizing this dataset, we can develop an understanding of how deep learning models can be trained on real-world image data and how they can be used for image classification tasks. This will provide valuable hands-on experience in building and training deep learning models for practical applications, specifically in the context of image classification using the flower_photos dataset as a learning resource.
